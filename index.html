        <div class="bs-example">
            <p class="lead">The following presents a language analysis of 3200 tweets sent over the past six months since September 21st 2017 until April 6th 2018 from @JulianAssange.
              The starting and ending dates of this data frame have relevant importance.

              In late September 2017, Assange emerged as one of the loudest voices on Twitter amplifying news and commentaries about Catalonia’s secession referendum.
              One month later, Ecuador’s foreign ministry warned Assange over Catalonia comments.
              Yet his communiques kept interfering in the affairs of other states and consequently risking the international relations that the newly elected government seems to restore.
              Recently, as of March 27th 2018, Assange has been barred from using the internet at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.</p>

                    <p class="lead">An analysis of 3,200 tweets sent by Julian Assange over the past six months.</p>
                    <img src="svg_files/ja_timeline_1.svg" alt=”Bar”>
                    <p>As April 6th 2018 Julian’s Assange’s Twitter account (@JulianAssange) recorded 5.484 twetets, 779 mil followers, and only 26 friends he follows.
                      His first joined the network October 2011. His Twitter’s account description reads:
                      “Publisher @WikiLeaks; I open governments.
                      Arbitrarily detained in violation of UN ruling WGAD/54/2015.
                      Unless otherwise stated positions are my own”.

                      The data clearly shows a rise in late October at the moment that Catalonia Independence was a hot topic.
                      Later it decreased slowly until November when it was the first time the internet was turned off in the Ecuadorian Embassy.
                      However, in that occasion it lasted only a day or two.
                      The plot clearly shows a dramatically decrease in the amount of tweets from that point of time to slowly arising from mid-January once again.
                      It also shall be mention that the small spike seen in late December represents the time when Assange was granted Ecuadorian citizenship.
                      Finally, the line finishes right before the month of April, specifically on March 27th 2018, when Assange has been barred from using
                      the internet at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.</p>

                      There are some Spanish prepositions as well which could not been taken away during the language analysis despite applying the stop_words function.</p>

                        In addition, the account of the Ecuadorian President @lenin occupies the eighth position out of 15th.
                        On the other hand, in the Spanish written tweets @lenin lays on the last position of the most common words and the account of the foreign minister @mfespinosaec has many more mentions as well as the international embassy @cancilleriaec.</p>
